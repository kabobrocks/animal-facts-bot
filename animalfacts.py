    "A sloth's body is usually 50 to 60 cm long. Skeletons of now extinct species of sloth suggest some varieties used to be as large as elephants.",
    'Sloths mainly eat the tree buds, new shoots, fruit and leaves, of the Cecropia tree. Some two-toed sloths also eat insects, small reptiles, and birds.',
    'Sloths have a four-part stomach that very slowly digests the tough leaves they eat, it can sometimes take up to a month for them to digest a meal. Digesting this diet means a sloth has very little energy left to move around making it one of the slowest moving animals in the world.',
    'Sloths can move along the ground at just 2 m (6.5 ft) per minute! In the trees they are slightly quicker at 3 m (10 ft) per minute.',

    'The sloth has very long, sharp, and strong claws that they use to hold on to tree branches. The claws are also their only natural defense against predators.',

    'Two-toed sloths are nocturnal, being most active at night. While three-toed sloths are diurnal which means they are most active during the day.',
    'It used to be thought sloths slept for 15 to 20 hours a day. However, its now believed they only sleep around 10 hours a day.',

    'The scorpion is nocturnal, often hiding during the day under rocks and in holes in the ground before emerging at night to feed.',
    'Scorpions can eat a massive amount of food in one meal. Their large food storage organs, together with a low metabolism rate and an inactive lifestyle means that if necessary they can survive 6-12 months without eating again.',

    'The scorpion is one of the 12 signs of the Zodiac, with the Scorpio constellation identified in the stars.',

    'A baby whale is called a calf. Whales form groups to look after calves and feed together. These groups are often made up of all female or all male whales.',
    'Whales that are found in both Northern and Southern hemisphere never meet or breed together. Their migration is timed so that they are never in breeding areas at the same time.',
    'The arched lower lip of a whale can often make it look like it is smiling! However, this isn’t a “real” smile as the blubber in the head of the whale prevents the muscles of the face from reaching the surface.',
    'You can tell the age of a whale by looking at the wax plug in its ear. This plug in the ear has a pattern of layers when cut lengthwise that scientists can count to estimate the age of the whale.',
